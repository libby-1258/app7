<!--added in alert to display allergy count and cold count-->
<!--added in function to calculate and display results-->
<!--var total will add allergy count and cold count to get the total-->
<!--added an alert for percentage display to results by dividing the allergy count by total and multiplying by 
100, then did the same for cold count so both percentages are displayed-->
<!--added a second alert to show up on page using \n-->
<!--closed function using }-->
	   <!--edited variables and functions to appendicitis/gas for new survey-->
	   <!--edited results function for new variables-->
		<!--added alert function to notify when doc was last modified-->
		<!--edited results function to have results appear on page rather than in alert box-->
		<!--deleted my appendicitis and gas count alerts-->
		<!--added quotation marks to fix results function-->
			<!--edited and added to the orginal vars to match diseases being looked at in this questionnaire-->
			<!--edited and added to the orginal functions to match diseases being looked at in this questionnaire-->
			<!--edited the results function somewhat to match new vars, but will most likely be removed to make a new result display later-->
