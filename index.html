        var appendicitis_count = 0;
        var gas_count = 0;
	var docMod = document.lastModified;
	alert("This file last modified  " + docMod);
	console.log("This file last modified  " + docMod);
<!--this added alert will notify the person who clicked the link of when the link was last modified-->
	<!--changed variables to appendicitis and gas for new survey-->
<!--function to keep track of the appendicitis answers on survey-->
		<!--edited function variable for new survey-->
	
        function appendicitisAdd(){
            appendicitis_count = appendicitis_count + 1;
		alert("Appendicitis count: " + appendicitis_count);
        }

<!--function to keep track of the gas annswers on survey-->
			<!--edited function variable for new survey-->
	
        function gasAdd(){
            gas_count = gas_count + 1;
		alert("Gas count: " + gas_count);
        }
	
<!--function to calculate the results of allergy vs cold count at end of survey-->
	
	function results(){
	    var total = appendicitis_count + gas_count;
		alert("Appendicitis Percentage: " + (appendicitis_count / total) * 100 +
		      "\nGas Percentage: " + (gas_count / total) * 100);
	}

  </script>
<!--added in alert to display allergy count and cold count-->
<!--added in function to calculate and display results-->
<!--var total will add allergy count and cold count to get the total-->
<!--added an alert for percentage display to results by dividing the allergy count by total and multiplying by 
100, then did the same for cold count so both percentages are displayed-->
<!--added a second alert to show up on page using \n-->
<!--closed function using }-->
	   <!--edited variables and functions to appendicitis/gas for new survey-->
	   <!--edited results function for new variables-->
