<!--added in function to calculate and display results-->
<!--var total will add allergy count and cold count to get the total-->
<!--added an alert for percentage display to results by dividing the allergy count by total and multiplying by 
100, then did the same for cold count so both percentages are displayed-->
<!--added a second alert to show up on page using \n-->
